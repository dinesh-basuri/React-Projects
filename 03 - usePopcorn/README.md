### A webApp build completly using ReactJs. Building this app makes me more confident in useState ,useEffect Hook and Handling external API.

### Using this app we can give the rating to the movies that we like, upon rating we can also add that movie to the watchlist.

### The complete movies data along with the movie details are coming from the external API.
